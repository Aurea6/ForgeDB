   ```bash
   npm i @tryforge/forge.db sqlite3
   ```
2. Now, in your client initialization:
   ```js
   const { ForgeClient } = require("@tryforge/forgescript")
   const { ForgeDB } = require("@tryforge/forge.db")
   
   /* I'm assuming that the client can be an app or anything else */
   const client = new ForgeClient({
       ...options // The options you currently have
       extensions: [
           new ForgeDB()
       ]
   })
   ```
Congratulations, you have successfully connected your client to a local database.

<h3 align="center">MongoDB Installation</h3><hr>

1. Run the following command to install the required `npm packages`:
   ```bash
   npm i @tryforge/forge.db mongodb
   ```
2. Now, in your client initialization:
   ```js
   const { ForgeClient } = require("@tryforge/forgescript")
   const { ForgeDB } = require("@tryforge/forge.db")
   
   // I'm assuming that the client, can be an app or anything else
   const client = new ForgeClient({
       ...options // The options you currently have
       extensions: [
           new ForgeDB({
               type: "mongodb",
               url: "Your_MongoURI_URL"
           })
       ]
   })
   ```
Congratulations, you have successfully connected your client to a MongoDB database.

<h3 align="center">Other Installation</h3><hr>
<p align="center">You're here because you want to try other DBs. So now just follow the steps below to set up your bot to work with other DBs:</p>

1. You have to first install ForgeDB, so you just run this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm i @tryforge/forge.db
   ```
2. Now that you've installed ForgeDB, you'll now have to install the DB package you want to use. Here are the ones ForgeDB currently supports:
   - **Better Sqlite3**
     ```bash
     npm i better-sqlite3
     ```
   - **MySQL**
     > *MySQL has two versions, you can use either of them.*
     - `MySQL`
       ```bash
       npm i mysql
       ```
     - `MySQL2`
       ```bash
       npm i mysql2
       ```
    - **Postgres**
      ```bash
      npm i postgres
      ```
3. Now that you have installed your preferred DB package, you now have to connect it with ForgeDB and ForgeScript:
   ```js
   const { ForgeClient } = require("@tryforge/forgescript")
   const { ForgeDB } = require("@tryforge/forge.db")
   
   // I'm assuming that the client, can be an app or anything else
   const client = new ForgeClient({
       ...options // The options you currently have
       extensions: [
            new ForgeDB({
               type: ""; // You've to put the DB you want to use. Available: mysql, postgres, better-sqlite3, sqlite, mongodb
               url?: string
               host?: string
               port?: number
               username?: string
               password?: string
               database?: string // The path of your DB
           })
       ]
   })
   ```

Congratulations, you have now successfully connected your database to ForgeDB and your client.

<h3 align="center">Android Installation</h3><hr>
<p align="center">You are here because your an android user and have already followed on setting up <a href="https://docs.botforge.org/p/ForgeDB/#docs-22-host-your-bot-on-android">ForgeScript on android</a> and are using ACode & Termux.</p>

1. You have to go in the `home` directory run this command:
  ```bash
  mkdir .gyp
  ```
2. Now you have to open ACode and open Termux's `home` directory and make a new file named `include.gypi`.
3. Now open `include.gypi` and paste this code:
  ```gypi
  {'variables':{'android_ndk_path': ''}}
  ```
4. Now save the file and open Termux again.
5. Now open the directory where you've setup your bot and run this command:
  ```bash
  npm i @tryforge/forge.db
  ```
<strong>It is not recommended to store data on your device, using a VPS server or any other thing to host your bot is recommend.</strong>

<h3 align="center">Events</h3><hr>

- What are DB events?
  > DB events are the events which get triggered when certain activities happen in your DB.
- How are they helpful in developing apps powered by ForgeScript?
  > DB events are really helpful in developing apps powered by ForgeScript, as they help you in monitoring activity in your DB and improve your logs.
- How to use them?
  > Now when you finish configuring your database, you will have to head over to the main file of your client and you will have to type this:

  ```js
  const { ForgeClient } = require("@tryforge/forgescript")
  const { ForgeDB } = require("@tryforge/forge.db")
  
  const db = new ForgeDB({
      ...options? // The options you have for ForgeDB, if any.
      events: [] /* The events you want to use. 
      Available: connect, variableCreate, variableUpdate, variableDelete */
  }) 
  
  const client = new ForgeClient({
      ...options // The options you currently have
     extensions: [ db ]
  })
  
  db.commands.add({
     type: "" // Available types: connect, variableCreate, variableUpdate, variableDelete
     code: `Your_Code_Goes_Here`
  })
  ```
